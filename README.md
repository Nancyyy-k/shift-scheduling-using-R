# Shift Scheduling Optimization Using Integer Programming (R)

This project applies Integer Programming in R to minimize weekly labor costs while
meeting daily worker requirements across seven different shift patterns.

## Files Included
- **FML Assignment 6.Rmd** – R Markdown file containing the full optimization model and R code.
- **FML-Assignment-6.html** – Knitted HTML report with results, plots, and interpretation.

## Objective
To build an Integer Programming model that determines the least-cost staffing plan
while ensuring the required number of workers is available each day.

## Tools & Libraries
- **R**
- **lpSolveAPI**
- **RMarkdown**

## Methods
- Defined 7 shift patterns with fixed wages.
- Formulated daily staffing constraints based on worker demand.
- Minimized weekly labor costs using Integer Programming.
- Generated a detailed report using RMarkdown.

## Results
- Identified the optimal number of workers per shift.
- Reduced labor costs while fulfilling all daily staffing requirements.
- Demonstrated how optimization techniques can improve operational planning.
